    			<h3>Open Data and Open Government are revolutionary.</h3>
    			
    			<br />
    			
    			<p>They promise to change the power dynamics that govern our societies, giving ordinary citizens more and deeper information, in real time, along with digital tools for engaging with both their peers and those in positions of power.</p>
    			
    			<p>So, why are so few citizens using either the data or the tools -- despite generous funding and massive institutional support?</p>
    			
    			<p>The problem, <i>Code for Africa</i> believes, is an issue of supply versus demand. Much of the focus by the civic technology movement to date has been on governments and activists pushing data and services at citizens, rather than listening to what citizens really want or need. This tension is even reflected is the definition we use to define the movement:</p>
    			
    			<br />
    			
    			<blockquote>
	    			<p><b>civ·ic</b> <span class="muted">/ˈsivik/</span> Adjective</p>
	    			<p>1. Of or relating to a city or town, esp. its administration; municipal.</p>
	    			<p>2. Of or relating to the duties or activities of people in relation to their town, city, or local area.</p>
    			</blockquote>
    			
    			<br />
    			
    			<p>Most open data and civic technology initiatives focus on the first definition, and are designed as government or activist / lobbyist led initiatives to improve the quality of services provided to citizens.</p>
    			
    			<p><i>Code for Africa</i> seeks a different path. It embraces the second definition, framing itself as a people-driven movement that aims to empower active citizenry as opposed to just building better government services.</p>
    			
    			<p>This approach is reflected in how <i>Code for Africa</i> is designed: the initiative is driven and co-funded by grassroots citizen organisations and the mass media and is focused primarily on building civic technology capacity within civil society and the watchdog media. <i>Code for Africa</i>'s current flagship programmes include:</p>

        	<div class="row">
        		<div class="span6">
        			<h3><i class="icon-magic"></i> Data Liberation</h3>
        			<p>Unlike North America or Europe, there is little open data freely available in Africa. And, where it is available, government data is often incomplete or skewed. A priority for <i>Code for Africa</i> is therefore to digitise and liberate data, turning 'deadwood' paper archives into a digital resource, or building APIs to access existing data. This includes going beyond government data, by hosting DataLiberation Scrapertons or supporting scraping projects such as openDUKA, to unlock the knowledge held in academia, the media, civil society, and citizen groups.</p>
        		</div>
        		<div class="span6">
        			<h3><i class="icon-lightbulb"></i> Data Skills</h3>
        			<p>Data is meaningless if no-one knows how to use it. <i>Code for Africa</i> therefore brings together pioneers who are already supporting data training, ranging from large institutional partners such as the World Bank, to industry associations such as the African Media Initiative, trend-setting corporates such as Google, and grassroots user-groups such as Hacks/Hackers to synchronise and amplify their programmes. The partnership includes evening seminars, more intensive policy roundtables, weeklong skills bootcamps, advanced masterclasses, and Code4Democracy hackathons.</p>
        		</div>
        	</div>
        	<div class="row">
        		<div class="span6">
        			<h3><i class="icon-group"></i> Data Fellowships</h3>
        			<p>But, even once people have skills and data, it is still difficult to get organisations to change the way they operate. <i>Code for Africa</i> therefore embeds change agents, as Data Fellows, in thought-leader media and civil society organisations to serve as catalysts and enablers who help create the internal systems and resources necessary to entrench data as 'mission critical'. The fellowships are supported by external civic technology labs, and run for six months each. Each fellow builds proof-of-concept services / apps, as well as helping to develop internal policy, data platforms, and recruitment / staff strategies.</p>
        		</div>
        		<div class="span6">
        			<h3><i class="icon-wrench"></i> Data Tools</h3>
        			<p>The best way to convince people about the power and relevance of data, is to point them to some showcase tools or services that demonstrate pragmatic potential. <i>Code for Africa</i> therefore supports the development of citizen-driven solutions, such as the GotToVote project in Kenya, or actNOW and askAFRICA projects in Ghana and South Africa. But, there is a real danger that scarce resources are wasted reinventing the wheel. <i>Code for Africa</i> therefore champions re-use and replication wherever appropriate, by supporting the work of pioneers such as mySociety and others.</p>

        	<h2>Africa Is Not A Country</h2>
        	<p>The continent is made up of 54 nations, further differentiated by language, religion, and shared history. <i>Code for Africa</i> is therefore merely an umbrella for a series of national or thematic initiatives, including:</p>
        	
        	<div class="row">
        		<div class="span4"></div>
        	</div>
        	<p>Code for Ghana   |   Code for Kenya   |   Code for Nigeria   |   Code for South Africa</p>
        	<p>Additional initiatives are being incubated, for possible launch in late 2013, in Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Uganda.</p>
        	
        	<hr style="margin: 50px 0;" />
        	
        	<h2>AfricanCommons</h2>
        	<p>It is important to tie together all the ingenuity, knowledge, and resources being created by the <i>Code for Africa</i> and their counterparts in the Americas and Europe community. We are therefore supporting a global effort to strengthen the CivicCommons platform, by evolving it beyond its current life as a simple catalogue into a dynamic community portal.</p>
        	<p>In addition to working on CivicCommons, <i>Code for Africa</i> is building other shared resources, including the continent's largest repository of open data, openAFRICA.</p>
        	
        	<hr style="margin: 50px 0;" />
        	
        	<h2>Partnerships</h2>
        	<p>Achieving Open Data and Open Government on a continental level is a mammoth task. <i>Code for Africa</i> is therefore deliberately designed as a vehicle for partnerships, to allow for shared knowledge and collaborative solutions, driven by thematic champions and diverse approaches. <i>Code for Africa</i>'s founding partners are:</p>
